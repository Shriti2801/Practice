        <h1>Coding is Fun</h1>
        <p>Hey there, I am Shriti and I have always been scared of coding until I actually started doing it.</p>
        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/robogarden-new/Articles/upload/blogs/lg-leverage-of-coding.jpg" alt="Learn to code"
        width="300" height="250">
        <p>Coding always seemed very overwhelming to me cuz I never tried understanding how powerful and fun problem solving is.</p>
        <p>Designing something that could help people was always my dream until i realized I need to give long hours and efforts to my computer.</p>
        <p>Slowly,the fear turned into Passion. If I can do it, then you can do it as well.</p>
        <p>And that's how I kept my fear aside and made a win win relationship with my computer.</p>
        <h2>How did I start?</h2>
        <p>Well, I started it with a lot of <em>Procastination</em></p>
        <p>That is something you should never do. If you want to start, Start by asking yourself <em>Why?</em></p>
        <p>If it drives you crazy, well <strong>Great!</strong>If not you are like me, You will need a push and that is pretty easy to be honest.</p>
        <p>Surround yourself with positivity and <strong>YOU CAN DO IT</strong> attitude. Be in an environment where people support growth and kindness, because that's what helped me start.
        Start learning by simply starting</p>
        <p>I started with most basic markup language-<em>HTML</em> and I can say I learnt it well.</p>
